            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I go as faſt as I can; but your anger interrupts me ſo, that I'm fain ſometimes to go back to recover my Tongue, though I have nothing within me but what is much to the purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>We were but newly return'd to <hi>Caſtille</hi> when <hi>Don Ferdinand de Rochas</hi> propos'd his Daughter to you in Marriage: her Picture was made a Preſent to you, and the offer of Twenty thouſand Crowns in portion, and then you (t'inchant her with your own Picture as much as you were charm'd by hers) made haſte to ſend her it: and ſo, as the Proverb ſays, put an old Cat to an old Rat. It was a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtratagem, and villanouſly ſubtle. But Heav'n (not always a Friend to Lovers) ordain'd a ſucceſs in ſpite of expectation.</p>

                  <p>Nay, Sir, ſince you love unwelcome brevity, know when I was to ſend away the laſt Packet, I would (being a little curious) compare the workmanſhip of my Picture with yours.

                  <p>At my return from the Warr to <hi>Burgos,</hi> I found my ſelf attacqu'd with two different Evils. I had a Brother murder'd and was

                  <p>Ah! no more reaſoning, when reaſon grows ſuperfluous. But prithee mark the counſel which Love ſuggeſts to me. My hope lies in thee.

                  <p>Theſe kind of diſguiſes ſmell too much of the Cudgel. I'ld rather proceed to reaſoning agen.

                  <p>Fear not that; for then the miſchief will be mine: but I, being <hi>Tod'let,</hi> may get acquainted with my Rivals man. I'll be a Lover from the Kitchin to the Garret; and my Preſents ſhall open the Locks of every boſome: whilſt thou (eating like a Shanker, and

                  <p>Sir, <hi>Burgos</hi> is the Town where I receiv'd my firſt being, and unfortunately the flames of Love. My Mother dy'd at my birth, and my Father deceaſ'd ſoon after her when he perceiv'd the misfortune of my love. His name was <hi>Diego d' Alverad.</hi> He bred me with great care and bounty, and he had much hope of my Infancy; but alas! it was a falſe hope. My Two Brothers were no leſs cheriſht by him, and I as much by them; with whom I happily liv'd. But oh, how love did change my deſtiny!</p>

                  <p>A Stranger who came to ſee the Triumphs at <hi>Burgos</hi> did in thoſe Turnements appear to have no equal.

               <l>Thoſe very old frumps, perhaps, would be pretty;</l>
               <l>But, Gallants, we have not the dulneſs to fit ye.</l>
               <l>They grow too ſtale, and the Reader who looks</l>
               <l>Upon the ſad Notes of many Shop-books</l>
               <l>Will think that the Cits have ſeldome undone ye.</l>
